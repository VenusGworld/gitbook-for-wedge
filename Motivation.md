It has been over a decade since blockchain became a technology under people’s focus. However, there are some challenges to make blockchain a pervasive platform for landing trustful and decentralized e-commerce applications. There are concepts proposed for physical backed tokens that represent the real-world items, also people may think about using the Semi-Fungible Token5 to address the transformation from fungible items to collectables. 
However, existing solutions still require off-chain activities to maintain the security of the transactions and lack a way to represent the state of the token itself, whether it is backed by products or the product it represents has been used.
To make an e-Commerce system running independently and fully decentralized on blockchain, building a decentralized e-commerce protocol is essential.
WEDGE TOKEN is a set of rules, contracts and data models for a decentralized e-commerce platform, there is no central authority there, and the rule is equal and trusted by everyone, no matter if you are an e-commerce giant, or a common customer. Everyone has the equal opportunity to sell, buy, redeem, trade, return and refund based on the contracts – the platform is driven by TAP and run by a set of smart contracts on blockchain.
In general, TAP provided the following solutions for these challenges of running e-Commerce on blockchain.
