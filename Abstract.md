This whitepaper introduces WEDGE TOKEN, a decentralized protocol to build trustful e-Commerce solutions on blockchain. The protocol defines 4 main subsystems of e-Commerce: Marketplace, Trading, Redemption and After-Sale. Each of the subsystems can work independently with supporting modules to manage the assets, users, and products. When discussing the topic, this whitepaper also introduced Stateful Universal Token (SUT), a new standard to represent the state changes of the token when presenting real-world products in the e-Commerce processes.
